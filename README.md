# Deep-Learning-Model-for-Tea-Leaf-Quality-Detection
This project focuses on the automatic classification of tea leaves into two categories: Healthy (suitable for tea production) and Diseased (unsuitable for tea production) using deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers and tea processing industries in improving quality control and reducing manual inspection effort.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains images of tea leaves categorized into two classes:

Healthy Leaf – suitable for tea production

Diseased Leaf – not suitable for tea production
