# Deep-Learning-Model-for-Tea-Leaf-Quality-Detection
This project focuses on the automatic classification of tea leaves into two categories: Healthy (suitable for tea production) and Diseased (unsuitable for tea production) using deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers and tea processing industries in improving quality control and reducing manual inspection effort.
